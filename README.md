If you want to know about what Google Foobar is, you can check out this article : [Foobar: Google's Secret Hiring Technique](https://www.turing.com/kb/foobar-google-secret-hiring-technique)

If you ask my story, while using the Google search engine, my screen was interestingly divided and a message appeared in front of me.

After a quick search to understand the situation, I realized that Google sent me a secret challenge invitation and it all started when I clicked the *I want to play* button.

It has 5 levels and each problem in the levels has its own time limits. Time to solve each question in level 1, level 2 and level 3 is set as 168 hours while each question in level 4 is 360 hours, in level 5 it is 528 hours.

My goal was to learn rather than complete the levels quickly. The fact that most test cases were hidden made the process even more mysterious. The more I learned, the more fun I had.

Once I completed level 3, I was told I could share my codes with a Google recruiter and asked to fill in some information such as name, phone number, country, email address so they could contact me regarding career opportunities, events and programs. Afterwards, I continued with the other challenges and when I submitted my solution for level 5, these cute bunnies appeared.

In conclusion, I successfully completed all 5 levels consisting of 9 challenges.

I had coded my solutions in python and uploaded them for educational purposes only.
